      <p>I'm an information security researcher. My primary research interests
        are software vulnerabilities, cryptography, network protocols, and
        static analysis. I currently reside in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, a
        magical place where the temperature swings wildly between -40°C and
        +40°C. This amuses me greatly. I will never move.</p>

      <p>My original plan was to pursue a PhD in Computer Science in the hopes
        of dedicating my life to teaching and research, but I got restless
        before even finishing my Master's degree. Being of a hacker mindset, I
        decided to look for and create other opportunities to both teach and
        research outside of academia.</p>

      <p>In 2010, two friends and I founded SkullSpace, Winnipeg's hackerspace.
        Since then it has grown to roughly sixty paid members, and currently
        leases an entire two thousand square foot floor of a downtown
        building. SkullSpace contains a classroom in which I've taught courses
        on Lua and C, a workshop on Wireshark and SSL, and given talks on CTFs
        and Forth. SkullSpace also provides tools and people to assist me in my
        research.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2013, I travelled to the University of California,
        Berkeley to teach a full-day workshop at Sharkfest on using Wireshark to
        troubleshoot SSL/TLS. People paid money for it, nobody asked for it
        back, and everyone returned after the lunch break, so I'm calling it a
        rousing success.</p>

      <p>I think my personality is best summed up by the most memorable
        compliment I've ever received: "You're the most genuine person I've ever
        met." The point being that the speaker always knew exactly what to
        expect from me, usually as a result of me explicitly telling him. I
        enjoy talking, whether I'm doing it or someone else is, which usually
        results in everyone around me knowing what I'm thinking. Reactions
        vary. I like that.</p>

      <p>In September of 2014, I returned to the Master's program with a
	different focus than before, and a life (friends, child, job) outside of
	academia to keep me balanced. I'm hoping to do better this time.</p>

      <p>I've had a plush squirrel in my pocket my entire adult life. I just
	thought you should know that.</p>
