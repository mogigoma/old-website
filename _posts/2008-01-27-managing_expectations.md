summary: Male pattern baldness takes preparation.
---

I just got my hair cut, for the first time in six months. Previously, I'd shaved
my head bald a few times. So today, I got out the clippers and enlisted my
father (Pierre) to help out.

  <dt>Pierre</dt><dd>You realize that this is going to look bad, like your Dad did it.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>That's okay. I've carefully established, by shaving my head bald a few times, that Katie won't leave me no matter how dumb my hair looks.</dd>
