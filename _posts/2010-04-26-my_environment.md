      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>I was describing to a co-worker my habit of falling asleep on my
      computer. To expand on my description of the physical setup of my room, I
      decided to take pictures of it. The pictures aren't particularly good, but
      they're far better than my description was. Also, I don't believe in
      scaling down images. <em>Cope</em>.</p>

      <p>The most striking feature of my room is the absence of a standard
      bed. Though some would guess that I favour Japanese sleeping arrangements,
      the truth is that I broke my futon. My matress will be replaced by a
      proper bed when Katie and I move in together later this year.</p>

      <h2>Computer</h2>

      <p>The most important thing in my room is my computer: <abbr title="BRISBANE (n.): A perfectly reasonable explanation (Such as the one offered by a person with a gurgling cough which has nothing to do with the fact that they smoke fifty cigarettes a day.)">Brisbane</abbr>. Nowadays it runs <a
      href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD 8-STABLE</a>, prompted by an
      unfortunate incident involving <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo
      Linux</a> and <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29">dd(1)</a>. Brisbane
      replaced my previous desktop, <abbr title="SHENANDOAH (n.): The infinite smugness of one who knows they are entitled to a place in a nuclear bunker.">Shenandoah</abbr>, after an ill-advised experiment which caused Shenandoah to catch fire in
      2006. Brisbane has a Dual Core AMD Opteron&#8482; Processor 165 and 1.5
      GiB of RAM.</p>

      <p>On top of my computer is a plush <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain">Lain</a> and a
      plush squirrel. My mouse is a <a
      href="http://www.logitech.com/en-ca/mice_pointers/trackballs/devices/166">Logitech
      TrackMan&#174; Wheel</a>, and my keyboard is a <a
      href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/">Das Keyboard</a>.</p>

      <h2>Comics, Wall Scrolls, and Trunk</h2>

      <p>In this picture, you can see my three wall scrolls from <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note">Death Note</a>, <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain">Serial
      Experiments Lain</a>, and <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_or_Die">Read or Die</a>. Below
      them are the boxes containing my comics, which I started collecting again
      in November, after more than twelve years. In the trunk are a variety of
      personal items, notably my wedding ring and the medal I received upon
      graduating university. Finally, we have my filing cabinet, in which I keep
      ridiculously well-organized records.</p>

      <h2>Bookshelf</h2>

      <p>If my house burned down, there are two things that I'd be hard-pressed
      to replace. My multi-terabyte fileserver, <abbr title="ELY (n.): The first, tiniest inkling you get that something, somewhere, has gone terribly wrong.">Ely</abbr>, would be impossible
      to replace. When you have that much data, backing it up is a
      <em>bitch</em>. Less difficult, but more costly to replace would be my
      collection of books, and trade paperbacks of comics. You may notice that I
      am fast running out of space. In truth, my books outgrew my bookshelf over
      a year ago, and were my friends to return all they've borrowed, I'd be in
      trouble.</p>

      <p>The toolbox is filled with cabling, screwdrivers, and lockpicks.</p>

      <h2>Closet</h2>

      <p>My closet contains mostly dress shirts, and two suits: one for Brad's
      wedding, and one for mine. It also once contained Dave, but that's another
      story.</p>

      <h2>Degree and Einstein</h2>

      <p>Here you can see a random framed picture of a squirrel. Why? Because
      squirrels are awesome, that's why. Above that is my long-awaited degree:
      Bachelor of Science &mdash; Major, Computer Science with Co-operative
      Option, with Distinction. In the center you can see the Einstein poster
      I've had since I was nine, and the two action figures that Katie brought
      back from her vacations: <a
      href="http://www.royalbaconsociety.com/store/viewProduct.php?ProductID=82">Saint
      Anthony</a> (patron saint of bacon), and <a
      href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/71a4/">Einstein</a>
      (with equation-solving action). On the right is my dry-mounted poster of
      the <a href="http://www.cpepweb.org/cpep_sm_large.html">elementary
      particles</a>.</p>

      <h2>Posters</h2>

      <p>There are only two more features of note in my room. The first is my
      framed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table">periodic
      table</a>, which I've had since I was seven or eight. The second is a
      dry-mounted map of the <a

      spectrum</a>.</p>

      <h2>In Closing</h2>

      <p>So there you have it, that's my room for the moment. A few months from
      now, I'll be moving out of this small space into a hopefully less-small
      house.</p>
