I was talking to Brad on MSN, and I randomly started by saying:

    (20:12:52)  Mak: *dances*
    (20:13:24) Brad: *prances*
    (20:13:30)  Mak: *jigs*.
    (20:13:42) Brad: *jives*
    (20:15:40)  Mak: *boogies*
    (20:16:09) Brad: *shuffles*
    (20:16:18)  Mak: *jitterbugs*

    (20:18:02) Brad: *Batman*
    (20:18:09)  Mak: *moonwalk*
    (20:18:30)  Mak: (BTW, saw Brennan Kyle at Sal's last night. Brennan is learning to Moon-Walk)
    (20:18:52) Brad: *breakdances* (Cool.)

    (20:22:10) Brad: *tap* (we really should stop this, before it gets silly :P)
    (20:22:41)  Mak: *riverdance* (I think that point is long past)
    (20:23:27) Brad: *cabaret* (Oh I think it has a way to go yet)
    (20:23:49)  Mak: *ballroom* (Doesn't it always, with us?)
    (20:24:41) Brad: *waltz* (sadly yes!)

    (20:30:54) Brad: *grooving* (and we used swing!)
    (20:31:49)  Mak: *west coast swing* (It's not swing dancing, it's some weird specific country style)
    (20:33:07) Brad: *two-step*
    (20:33:32)  Mak: *liquid* (Nice one!)

    (20:37:33) Brad: *dirty*
    (20:38:23)  Mak: *that guy from the beer commercial where they say "What the hell is this idiot doing?"* (You know, we think too much alike, I was just about to use that one, too.)

    (20:43:25) Brad: *highland fling*
    (20:43:49)  Mak: *Butterfly Wedding Dance* (I'll have to take your word on the highland fling)
    (20:45:53) Brad: *Russian leg flingy dance* (I think it's different from sword dancing)
    (20:46:35)  Mak: *Ukrainian leg flingy dance* (I know there's a Ukrainian one, too!)

    (20:53:11) Brad: *zoot suit boogie*
    (20:54:06)  Mak: *Triple-Two*
    (20:54:57) Brad: *Stewie's "sexy parties" dance*
    (20:56:02)  Mak: *Dance Dance Revolution* (Quote from the Dance at Ai-Kon: "How am I supposed to dance to this? There aren't any arrows on the ground!")
    (20:58:06) Brad: ( :| ) *belly*
    (20:58:16)  Mak: *Ratbert's "I'm Naked!" Dance* (Once we hit 21:12:52 by my clock, we'll have been at this for an hour. That's something worth striving for!)
    (20:59:37) Brad: *lambada* (cool!)
    (21:00:46)  Mak: *La Coucaracha* (Cockroach dance! I'll tell you when my clock hits an hour. Hooray for timestamps!)
    (21:01:40) Brad: *YMCA* (We can do it!)
    (21:02:04)  Mak: *Macarena* (Of course we can. It's us and it's *stupid*!)
    (21:02:50) Brad: *that chicken dance*

    (21:03:23) Brad: *conga line*
    (21:04:24)  Mak: *"You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals" music-video-ass-tappin' dance*

    (21:07:08) Brad: *bunny hop*
    (21:08:02)  Mak: *Wesley Wyndam-Pryce's Dance on that episode of Angel* (It's on my DVDs. It's how I would dance if I ever did. *shudder*)
    (21:09:49) Brad: *rubber ducky* (Jenn mentioned it one day. It's more than just a song!)
    (21:11:13)  Mak: *That stupid dance that I have the image of a girl w/ long blond hair punching straight up w/ alternating hands as she jumps on alternating feet and shakes her head back and forth* (Read: Bad 80's dancing)
    (21:12:58) Brad: *Time Warp*

Mission completed.
