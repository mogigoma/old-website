This week, I saw an individual that I haven't seen in six years. I have no idea
who this person is, what his name is, or anything about him except what I saw
years earlier. Upon seeing him as I came down a flight of stairs in the
Engineering Complex at the university, I immediately froze and gripped the
railing tightly for fear of pointing and laughing uncontrollably. What could
prompt such a reaction? My dog learns quicker than this guy.

In my first year of university, I had Calculus every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. It was a class of at least a two hundred people tightly packed into a
room with two sets of double doors. Ten minutes before the end of each class,
this one guy would get up and leave through the doors at back of the room, where
I habitually sit. Every day, he'd <em>fucking plow</em> into the right-hand
door, which was always locked. He'd then take a moment to recover himself, and
then leave through the left-hand door, which was always unlocked. Courses will
run for about thirteen weeks, and to the best of my recollection he did this
every class, meaning roughly <em>forty</em> times.

I'm amazed that guy is still alive.
