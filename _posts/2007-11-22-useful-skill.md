summary: Is there a difference between optimism and self-delusion?
---

Katie likes things to be carefully planned, where I'm a fan of improvising:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Now, repeat after me: there is no plan.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>There <em>is</em> a plan.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd><em>*pats Katie on the head*</em> How cute!</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Almost four years in, and you can still delude yourself. That'll be a useful skill later on.</dd>
</dl>
