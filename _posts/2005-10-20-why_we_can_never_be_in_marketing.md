While discussing something confusing:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Okay, now I have a headache.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>What can I do to help?</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Sex.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Why sex?</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Because it apparently cures headaches.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Then why do women use it as an excuse to avoid sex?</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Not sure, but Niko told me that sex cures headaches, so it must be true. Niko is the third most reliable source of information in the world.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Tylenol should make condoms.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Like those flavoured ones?</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Yeah</dd>
</dl>

Tylenol-coated condoms, the power of two headache-relief medicines at
once. Use only as instructed. Keep out of reach of children. Should
accidental contact with eye occur, flush with water immediately.
