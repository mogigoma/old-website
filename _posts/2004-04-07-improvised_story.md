summary: Too bad we never finished.

Three weeks after we met, and two weeks after we'd been dating, Katie and I were
on chatting on MSN when she randomly said in the middle of our conversation:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Once upon a time</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>There was a duck-billed platypus named Weevil.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>One day Weevil and his squirrel friend Meril woke up to see some smoke in the distant North.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>"Oh my Gaia!", said Weevil. "Someone seems to have lit the Ki no Shushochi on fire!"</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Meril simply clicked his tongue a few times, and went back to eating the ripe, plump berries at the side of the lake.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Weevil gave Meril a disapproving look. "Well, I suppose I'll go see if there's anything I can do, since you appear to be unconcerned." And with that, Weevil began to walk Northward.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>With a mouth full of berries, Meril turned his head and blinked as Weevil walked away. He rolled his eyes, swallowing what he had stuffed in his mouth, and quickly jumped to his feet to catch up to Weevil. "What is with this Key thing?" Meril asked curiously, not understanding what Weevil knew.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Weevil just shook his head as he continued walking. "The Ki no Shushochi is the great big douglas fir tree that never loses its needles, no matter how cold it gets. It's the one that the old Albino Squirrel, Skippy, lives in." he explained.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>"Skippy?" Meril squeeked, his nose twitching from side to side as some ash had fallen onto it. He shrugged it off. "Oooo! I heard about this Ski... Ski... Skiiiiaaaaapppaaachooo!" Meril sneezed, the force flinging him back into a bush.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Weevil ducked under a log to avoid being hit by the sizable gob of berry-coloured mucus that had shot like an arrow straight for him. "I should hope you would have heard of him. He just happens to be the oldest animal in the forest. He says he remembers a time before there <em>was</em> any fire! I hope he's not still mad about the thing with you and his great-great-great-great-granddaughter, though.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>A rustling began in the bush as Meril stuck his face out of the bush and quickly came out, shaking dirt off of his body. "Who was that now?" Meril thought, thinking back to that time. Meril's eyes widened, "Oh, do you meant that sunlit brown-furred black-eyed goddess of a squirrel who... ooooo!" Meril's cheeks turned red as he remembered that day, and his tail flicked up.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Weevil emerged from beneath the log with a reproving glare. "No, not her, I meant her sister. You remember? The one you ditched the <em>moment</em> you met your 'Goddess'. Whatever happened to those two anyways? Didn't one join one of those radical minority groups, like the 'Animals for Ethical Treatment of Flora' or some such thing?"</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Meril shook himself out of his daze. "Yep, that's what happened!" Meril said, ignoring the ultimate moral of what had happened to him and those females, as he continued onwards, trying to jump over the log Weevil was beneath, failing horribly.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Weevil looked at Meril meaningfully before carrying on. Weevil never pretended or tried to understand the furry little bugger, and didn't ever hope to. It was probably better that way, because he always had a sneaking feeling that if he ever knew half of the things Meril had done in his life, he'd probably never let the creepy bastard near him ever again.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Meril rubbed his head from the bump he had recieved from the log. Shaking it off like many things he had before, he grinned slyly at Weevil. "So where are we going again?" he asked, then sniffing the air, "And what is that putrid stench?"</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Weevil sniffed the air himself a few times, cautiously at first, and then deeper. "I recognize that smell!" he said, trailing off. Then suddenly Weevil stopped dead, and a spark of realization came over his face, and before Meril had a chance to ask any questions, Weevil was running faster than should really be possible for such a goofy-looking animal to move making a beeline for the smoke.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>"Wait! Weevil, waai..." Meril shouted, his eyes then catching the glimmer of a beautiful female passing by some berry bushes. He smiled at her, she smirked at him, her eyes looking to the smoke, her nose twitching. Meril shook himself out of that daze, looking to the smoke as well, then to the tracks of his duck-billed buddy. "Oh, nuts and berries!" Meril squeeked under his breath and ran to catch up with Weevil.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>By the time Meril caught up to Weevil, he was standing in the clearing of the Tree of Life. The tree's bark seemed entirely unscathed by the roaring flames, but all the greenery on the tree was burning, giving off a horrible stench. As they watched, a sparrow dropped out of the fire to join the other limp, motionless bodies on the ground. "I hope Skippy's all right, at least," Weevil said.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>Meril stared at the bodies. "Weevil! Weevil! I think," Meril started, his face turning green, his cheeks puffing out, and his body waved from side to side, "I think I'm going to be..." Before he finished his sentence, Meril fainted.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Weevil just let Meril drop to the ground, not even making an effort to catch him. "Skippy? Skiiiiiiiippy?", he shouted. A few more animals had entered the clearing now, and most of them were able to keep themselves standing, unlike Meril. Weevil wandered closer towards the burning tree, hoping to see if Skippy was lying among the fallen. But he found nothing but some of the birds who lived upstairs from Skippy.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>A sleek auburn furred female squirrel ran right past Weevil, heading through the fire. "Gigi! Gigi!" She shouted up into the tree.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Meril suddenly sat bolt upright at the sound of the other squirrel's voice. This, of course, scared the nuts out of the chipmunk's cheeks who was right beside where Meril was lying.</dd>
  <dt>Katie</dt><dd>The female squirrel ran up the tree, to a fiery barrier ringed around the tree, stopping her from going any further. "Gigi! Gigi pleeeeasee... where are you?" She shouted up into the tree, hoping to get a reply, her eyes full of tears. "GIGI!!"</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>As the female squirrel shouted, everyone heard "Be quiet! I'm trying to get some shut-eye down here!" Out from the second lowest quarter of the tree poked the head of Skippy, the squirrel who looked more bone than flesh. "It took me three days to fall asleep, and I swear, the moment I do, someone starts yelling! Stop hollering and come up and <u>knock</u> on the door!". And with that, he was gone.</dd>

At this point we got bored and went on to discuss other things.
