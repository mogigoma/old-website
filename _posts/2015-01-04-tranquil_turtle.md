summary: River knows how to work her night-time comfort object.
---

Every night when I put River to bed, I turn on her Tranquil Turtle, a little
plush/plastic light projector and sound effect generator. It takes a press of
one button to turn it on, and two presses of another button to turn on all the
sounds. It has a total of six buttons. Tonight, I put her to bed and then
realized five minutes later that I'd forgotten to turn on Tranquil Turtle. When
I went in her room to do so, I found it already on and emitting light and sound
as usual. River knows how to operate Tranquil Turtle, in complete darkness to
boot!
