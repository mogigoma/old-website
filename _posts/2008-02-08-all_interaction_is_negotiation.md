summary: I fail at haggling.

In my Operating Systems 2 course, we have an assignment that was supposed to be
due today. Although it's not overly crazy (implementing priority donation on
locks, correcting wakeup behaviour of synchronization primitives, implementing
the BSD 4.4 scheduler, and removing all instances of busy-waiting from the
kernel), none of us are anywhere near done. My partner and I have worked on it
nightly since last Sunday, and I dedicated from 0800h Thursday until 1630h today
on it (stayed overnight in the computer lab), we're still nowhere near finished.

Today, the professor (Rasit) stopped by the lab to ask us how we were doing.

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Rasit</dt><dd>When did I say this assignment was due?</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Today, but you never gave a specific time.</dd>
  <dt>Rasit</dt><dd>And how far along are you?</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Nowhere far enough to finish without an extension.</dd>
  <dt>Rasit</dt><dd>How much time would you need?</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>I'm thinking March would work.</dd>
  <dt>Rasit</dt><dd><em>*laughs*</em> How about Monday?</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Now you're getting it! I say March, you say Monday, eventually we meet in the middle and you make it due in late February.</dd>
  <dt>Rasit</dt><dd>Ah, but you see in this case <em>I</em> am not the one that needs to negotiate.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Good point.</dd>
</dl>
