At work today, Ron and I got to have a heart-to-heart:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Sorry, I say some pretty random shit. Brad's girlfriend says that I have no filter between my brain and my mouth. I maintain that I have a moral obligation to state whatever comes into my head.</dd>
  <dt>Ron</dt><dd>I'm pretty sure that's some kind of disability.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>Nope. It's a moral obligation, I assure you.</dd>
  <dt>Ron</dt><dd>No, really, it has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome">name</a> even.</dd>
