summary: Being impolite can be useful.
---

While discussing my frustration in trying to get a job I had recently left to
pay me the money I was owed:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Pierre</dt><dd>You know, Mak, there's only so far in life you can go while being nice.</dd>
  <dt>Mak</dt><dd>I know, but it's nowhere near as far as I'd hoped.</dd>
</dl>

I realized after this that while it was important to be nice by default, being
intenionally impolite is very useful.
