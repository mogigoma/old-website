My mother relayed to me a conversation she had with a friend-of-the-family that
hasn't seen me in years:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Judy</dt><dd>Is Mak still so sweet and kind?</dd>
  <dt>Mom</dt><dd>Yes, except now he&#8217;s heartless.</dd>
  <dt>Judy</dt><dd>I don&#8217;t get what you mean by that.</dd>
  <dt>Mom</dt><dd>He speaks his mind.</dd>
  <dt>Judy</dt><dd>And how is that different from anyone <em>else</em> in your family?</dd>
  <dt>Mom</dt><dd>He does it without any <em>tact</em>.</dd>
</dl>
